---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

   * Restrict access to the files, for example, by including the following in your httpd.conf:
    <verbatim class="xml">
<Directory "/path/to/foswiki/pub/System/%TOPIC%/db">
  deny from all
</Directory>
<Directory "/path/to/foswiki/pub/System/CaptchaPlugin/fonts">
  deny from all
</Directory>
</verbatim>
   * Enable the plugin via the =bin/configure= script
   * Test if the installation was successful:
      * Create a topic containing the macro =%<nop>CAPTCHA%=
      * When loading this topic you should see an obfuscated character string loaded as a png and a hexadecimal hash.
      * Check whether the hash database is properly protected by going to the url http://my.wiki.server/my/foswiki/path/pub/System/%TOPIC%/db/hashes.pag, you should see a permission denied message.
   * Now edit your System.UserRegistration topic
      * Display the image =%CAPTCHA%= somewhere in your form, along with a text instructing new users to copy the obfuscated text into the appropriate text input.
      * For example, add this to your System.UserRegistration:
        <verbatim class="tml">%CAPTCHAFORM%</verbatim>

---+++ Captcha on topic edit

If you want to protect edits by %USERSWEB%.WikiGuest with a captcha, add the following line to your =lib/LocalSite.cfg=:

<verbatim>$Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{CaptchaPlugin}{EnableSave} = 1;</verbatim>

A =editcaptcha.tmpl= has been prepared for you. All you need to do is TMPL:INCLUDE it into your =edit*.tmpl=. Two patches are available for Pattern (=edit.pattern.tmpl=) and !NatSkin (=edittoolbar.nat.tmpl=).
