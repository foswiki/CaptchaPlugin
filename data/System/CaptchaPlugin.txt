---++ Description

This plugin tries to prevent automated scripts from creating users and spam your wiki. It does so by requiring a
simple test to ensure that the request is done by a human being. The Captcha encodes information into a distorted image
containing letters and digits. This information is easy to generate for the computer, easy to read for human beings but
hard to recognize by computers. Note however, that Captchas aren't 100% bullet proof. They only raise the bar for automated
scripts to pass the test. There are regular reports of Captchas of a specific kind being solved automatically for high profile internet sites.

!CaptchaPlugin tries to create challenge-response tests hard enough to solve for computers, but does not claim that its tests are unbreakable
on any scale. Read more about captchas at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA.
