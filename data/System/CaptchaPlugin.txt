---++ Description

This plugin tries to prevent automated scripts from creating users and spam your wiki. It does so by requiring a
simple test to ensure that the request is done by a human being. The Captcha encodes information into a distorted image
containing letters and digits. This information is easy to generate for the computer, easy to read for human beings but
hard to recognize by computers. Note however, that Captchas aren't 100% bullet proof. They only raise the bar for automated
scripts to pass the test. There are regular reports of Captchas of a specific kind being solved automatically for high profile internet sites.

!CaptchaPlugin tries to create challenge-response tests hard enough to solve for computers, but does not claim that its tests are unbreakable
on any scale. Read more about captchas at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA.

---++ Syntax Rules

---+++ CAPTCHA

This macro renders a simple captcha interface based on the =jqCaptcha= jQuery plugin (an image and a click handler to reload it). In most
cases you'd use the CAPTCHAFORM macro for a more ready-to-use widget.

---+++ CAPTCHAFORM

This simply expands to the captcha form as defined in the =captcha.tmpl= template. 

Parameters:

   * validateonsubmit: boolean value specifying when the form is being validated. If set to true (default) validation of the captcha will
     be performed on the client already when clicking on the "Submit" button. If set to false, validation happens on the server side only.
   * disableonsuccess: boolean value specifying when the challenge is going to be "consumed" while validating it on the client side. This defaults to false
     so that the server validation check on the same challenge gets a chance to pass as well.

---+++ CAPTCHACHECK

This macro can be used in own wiki applications to check a challenge at some point. It takes a challenge identifier and a response and verifies
it while expanding the macro. Based on the result either =error= or =success= is returned.

Parameters:

   * challenge: the captcha challenge identifier
   * response: the response as provided by the user
   * error: format string to be returned when validation failed
   * success: format string to be returned when validation succeeded

---++ Example

You type:

<verbatim class="tml">
<form action="%SCRIPTURLPATH{view}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#example" id="example">
<div class="foswikiFormSteps">
  %CAPTCHAFORM%
  <div class="foswikiFormStep">
    %BUTTON{"%MAKETEXT{"Submit"}%" icon="tick" type="submit"}%
    %CLEAR%
  </div>
</div>
</form>

%CAPTCHACHECK{
  challenge="%URLPARAM{"captcha_challenge"}%"
  response="%URLPARAM{"captcha_response"}%"
  error="%JQICON{"error"}% There was an error checking the validation code."
  success="%JQICON{"accept"}% The validation code has been checked successfully."
}%
</verbatim>

%IF{"context CaptchaPluginEnabled" else="<div class='foswikiHidden'>"}%
You get:

<form action="%SCRIPTURLPATH{view}%/%WEB%/%TOPIC%#example" id="example">
<div class="foswikiFormSteps">
  %CAPTCHAFORM%
  <div class="foswikiFormStep">
    %BUTTON{"%MAKETEXT{"Submit"}%" icon="tick" type="submit"}%
    %CLEAR%
  </div>
</div>
</form>

%CAPTCHACHECK{
  challenge="%URLPARAM{"captcha_challenge"}%"
  response="%URLPARAM{"captcha_response"}%"
  error="%JQICON{"error"}% There was an error checking the validation code."
  success="%JQICON{"accept"}% The validation code has been checked successfully."
}%

%IF{"context CaptchaPluginEnabled" else="</div>"}%

%IF{"context CaptchaPluginEnabled" then="<div class='foswikiHidden'>"}%
You get (if installed)

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/CaptchaSnap1.png" alt="captcha snapshot" />
%IF{"context CaptchaPluginEnabled" then="</div>"}%


---++ Captcha-protected editing of topics

By switching on the ={EnableSave}= parameter in your Foswiki configuration, editing wiki topics will be guarded by
requiring a captcha challenge to be passed. This feature is disabled by default as Foswiki core's own Strike-One mechanism
is already well suited to protect accidental save actions to be performed (e.g. as performed by spam bots). In some cases
an additional captcha guard might be interesting as to allow unauthenticated guests of a wiki to do regular edits.
Use the ={EnableSave}= switch to enable this. The captcha challenge for topic edits can also be demanded even for registered
users by enabling the ={SaveForAll}= flag. WARNING: this might raise the barrier to contribute to the wiki a bit too high
for practical use. Only enable this feature when you really know what you are doing.

As by now the ={EnableSave}= feature is best integrated into the [[Foswiki:Extensions/NatEditPlugin][NatEditPlugin]] while
needing extra provisions for other editors.
